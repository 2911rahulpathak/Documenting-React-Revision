Things to know in a frontend Framework:

1. Flex
2. Grids
3. Responsiveness
4. background color, text color, hover

Normally a div takes complete width
Flex: lets you position elements right next to each other 
flex start : all children should be at beginning
flex end:
center 
space-between
space around-> all of space equal and space/2 is left at the end and beginning 


one nuance here is instead of writing class in React.jsx file write className as it is a predefined thingy in JS 


import './App.css'

function App() {
 

  return (
    <>
      <div className='flex justify-between'>
      <div>hi</div>
      <div>hi</div>
      <div>hi</div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
