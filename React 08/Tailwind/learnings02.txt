Grids in Tailwind(forget flex for now and learn how to bring divs next to each other using grid)

Youtube: there is grid when you play a button 
className="grid grid-cols-3"
childrens could have different width depending on functionality:
className="col-span-5"
className="col-span-7"

depending on different span-width it will take the width
 

making divs with equal width can be done via Flexbox too

But Its tricky when it comes to do it with unequal widths & that's where Grid comes into picture 

grid-col-3 : how many parts I want to divide my window in & 3 is for 3 


import './App.css'

function App() {
 

  return (
    <>
      <div className='grid grid-cols-3'>
      <div className='bg-red-500'>hi</div>
      <div className='bg-green-500'>hi</div>
      <div className='bg-yellow-500'>hi</div>
      <div>h1</div>
      <div>hi</div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
