When ever first time the component is put on the DOM -> Is it what is called Mount
WHen ever it is put off the screen -> Unmounts
These are called Lifecycle events 

And you need to run some code when the component mounts & when the component unmounts 

The way to do that in functional component is UseEffect() 



#######################You can return a function from useEffect()

 useEffect(() => {
    // Perform setup or data fetching here
    console.log("Component mounted ")
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code (similar to componentWillUnmount)
      console.log("Component unmounted")
    };
  }, []);

  Make sure its a function 
  return ()=>{
    //It runs whenever the dependency changes
  }


  eg: If todos changes -> the function from last render would run first  & then the logic would run again

  First time the dependency changes, It will run from start 
  Then for the second time first code inside return function runs -> CleanUp karo -> i.e old useEffect is gone away
  The new Effect is being triggered again  

  useEffect(() => {
    // Perform setup or data fetching here
    console.log("Component mounted ")
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code (similar to componentWillUnmount)
      console.log("Component unmounted")
    };
  }, [todos]);
