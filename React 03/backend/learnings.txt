Creating a Todo Application:

Create  a Readme.md File (Can google for markdown editor online)
After Read me -> Frontend and the backend(First thingy generally build it)

We need to initialize a node project for backend folder
//put a package.json 
run npm install express(to create a HTTP server)

when you ran the command npm ___ -> new folder node_modules gets created & It brings alot of libraries from the internet to your machine
And not just express a bunch of libraries are installed -> express folder itself contains package.json

### when you are running your project you need the dependencies or node-modules
If you delete Node_modules -> run the command -> npm install because my package.json file consist of exhastive list of dependencies I added in past


now write basic express boilerplate code , with express.json() middleware
It adds req body -> req object

now add zod library to make input validation for the todo Application
/* inputs to expect
In body:{
    title:string;
    description:string

}
 */

 creating a new file and calling it types.js -> for zod input validation
