We are not yet doing client side routing:
Refresh happening in Top bar here 

because we use: 
window.location.href="something"

This is not a good way to do client side routing


import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import './App.css'
import { Dashboard } from './components/Dashboard'
import { Landing } from './components/Landing'

function App() {
 

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={()=>{
          window.location.href="/"
        }}>Landing Page</button>
        <button onClick={()=>{
        window.location.href="/dashboard"
         }}>Dashboard Page</button>
      </div>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard></Dashboard>}></Route>
        <Route path="/" element={<Landing></Landing>}></Route>
      </Routes>      
    </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App


There is this thing called as "useNavigate" Hook

If you import this useNavigate hook from react-router-dom
It makes sure it doesn't does hard reloading 

This is one of right way of doing client side routing 


useNavigate hook says whenever you are using me It expects to
make sure you are using me up in the component that's inside browser router
