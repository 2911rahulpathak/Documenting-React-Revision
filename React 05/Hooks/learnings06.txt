useCallbacks -> hook to memoize functions

a=1
b=1
if(a==b) -> true
Are they referentially equal? means reference of a and reference of this b is the same?

example 2: 
function sum(a,b){ return a+b}

function sum2(a,b){return a+b}

if(sum==sum2) -> False
even though they are exactly same but not referentially (are they in same place in memory)
They point to different locations in your ram/Memory
