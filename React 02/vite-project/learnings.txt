React is a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted in HTML/CSS/JS 

React -> npm run build -> HTML/CSS/JS 

#########################################################
For creating React App(worry about) : Component,State & Re-rendering

an object that represents the current state of the app (It represents dynamic things in your app-> things that change)

#############################################
UseState() -> To make React watch your state 
Everytime state changes the component re-renders 

const [count,setCount] = useState(0)
//useState function call returns array -> first thing puts it count & other one in setCount

what is [count,setCount]?? -> array destructuring 
const [a,b] =[1,2]  //take 1 and put it in a variable & take 2 and put it in b variable
Object desctructing : const {name} = {name:"ABC",age:21}  you get name as by doing object destructuring
